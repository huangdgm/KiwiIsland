The KiwiIsland project is a single player adventure game, which was originally initiated with the purpose of advocating the public environmental awareness. I led a team of three programmers and we applied the theory of software engineering by utilizing three sprints of development, in which we go through all the major methodologies that the SE requires, such as sprint planning, daily stand-up meeting, sprint retrospective and so on.
